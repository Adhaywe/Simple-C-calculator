#C-calculator
***********
This program simply takes three inputs(number 1, number 2 and an operator from the user and calculates the answer for the operation of the numbers based on the type of operator(*, /, +, -, ^) supplied by the user. A scanf() function is used for receiving the inputs and then a switch statement is used to run the right calculation.
